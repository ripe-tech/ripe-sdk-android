/**
 * Reactively updates the image of an ImageView whenever the state of its owner changes.
 * An Image can be configured with the following options:
 *
 * - **showInitials** - A [Boolean] indicating if the owner's personalization should be shown (defaults to `true`).
 * - **frame** - The Ripe instance frame to display (defaults to `0`).
 * - **size** - The image size in pixels (defaults to `1000`).
 * - **width** - The image width in pixels (defaults to `null`, meaning it will fallback to `size`).
 * - **height** - The image height in pixels (defaults to `null`, meaning it will fallback to `size`).
 * - **crop** - A Boolean indicating if it is to crop the image composition.
 * - **initialsBuilder** - A method that receives the *initials* and *engraving* as Strings and the ImageView that
 * will be used and returns a map with the initials and a profile list. This is the default method:
 *
 * ```
 * fun initialsBuilder(initials: String, engraving: String, view: ImageView): Map<String, Any> {
 *     return hashMapOf(
 *         "initials" to initials,
 *         "profile" to arrayOf(engraving)
 *     )
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @property imageView The ImageView that should be updated.
 * @property owner The [Ripe] instance to be shown.
 * @property options A map with options to configure the image.
 *
 * @constructor Constructs a new Image with the imageView, a Ripe instance as owner and a options map.
